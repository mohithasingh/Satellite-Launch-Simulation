The project **"SATELLITE LAUNCH SIMULATION"** is developed using **OpenGL** and demonstrates the process of a satellite launch. It features an interactive simulation where different stages of the launch are triggered using specific keyboard inputs.

The application begins with an **introduction page**, displaying the **college name, project title, student names,** and an animated rocket. Pressing **"I"** opens the **instructions page**, which provides details on the key controls for navigating through different stages.

- Pressing **"S"** displays a **static rocket scene**, showcasing a **launch pad, control center,** and a stationary rocket.  
- Pressing **"L"** initiates the **launch sequence**, where the rocket takes off from the launch pad on Earth and ascends into space.  
- Pressing **"M"** transitions to the **movement phase**, where the rocket moves through space while a star function generates stars in the background.  
- Pressing **"1"** triggers the **first dismantling phase**, where a portion of the rocket detaches, leaving the main body to continue in space.  
- Pressing **"2"** activates the **second dismantling phase**, where another section separates, and the satellite is released into space.  
- Pressing **"3"** displays the **satellite phase**, showing the satellite orbiting Earth while Earth revolves around the Sun.  
- Pressing **"E"** exits the program.  

This **2D simulation** is implemented using the **GLUT Toolkit** for graphics rendering. The project consists of seven functions, each corresponding to a specific stage of the launch and triggered using designated keyboard inputs.
